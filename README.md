# Automated Clover Builds

[![Build Status](https://www.bitrise.io/app/d99a8cc679de9944/status.svg?token=4iYU6RsLSXBRMno3j3GnJg&branch=master)](https://www.bitrise.io/app/d99a8cc679de9944)

A simple project that automatically builds [Clover](https://clover-wiki.zetam.org) as a daily build.

Note that these builds includes the [AptioFixPkg](https://github.com/vit9696/AptioFixPkg) (`AptioMemoryFix` and `AptioInputFix`) by [vit9696](https://github.com/vit9696).

**DISCLAIMER:** Since this is a 3rd party build, anything could go wrong, so proceed with caution. That said, it should be fine.
